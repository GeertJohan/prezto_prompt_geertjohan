## Prezto prompt geertjohan

This is my custom prompt. It uses three lines to display some information.
 - The first line shows the previous program's exit status, including exit code when not zero. The first line also displays the time it took for the process to run when > 1 second (currently not displaying miliseconds).
 - The second line displays the current working directory path, using a short notation (first character for each folder in the path, except current folder). The second line also displays git information when in a git repository.
 - The last line is the prompt input line, as usual.

Feel free to copy this prompt and modify to your own needs. Or open an issue or PR at this repo.
